# MVC-tic-tac-toe

MVC-tic-tac-toe is an implementation of the classic game of tic-tac-toe using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This design pattern separates the application into three interconnected components to promote modularity and maintainability.

## Views

To demonstrate the MVC pattern in action, this project provides two different views: ViewSimple and ViewComplex. Thanks to the MVC architecture, these views can be used interchangeably.

### `ViewSimple`
`ViewSimple` is a minimalistic and straightforward view of the tic-tac-toe game. 

### `ViewComplex`
Similar to `ViewSimple`, but a bit 'fancier' (eg. ASCII art)
